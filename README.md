# Memchr Benchmarking

This ongoing research project focuses on optimizing character search using low level parallelization. The current benchmarks are exclusive to x86 architecture. Next steps include supporting other architectures and expanding pattern matching from character to word search. Coded by Kevin Endres under the guidance of MichaÃ«l Cadilhac (DePaul University) and Charles Paperman(University of Lille, France).
